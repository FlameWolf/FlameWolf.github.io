			<p>The state of India’s economy is deeply worrying. I say this, not as a member of the Opposition political
				party, but as a citizen of this country and as a student of economics. By now, the facts are evident to
				all — nominal GDP growth is at a 15-year low; <a
					href="https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/unemployment-rate-at-45-year-high-confirms-labour-ministry-data/article27379174.ece"
					title="unemployment is at a 45-year high">unemployment is at a 45-year high</a>; household consumption
				is at a four-decade low; bad loans in banks are at an all-time high; growth in electricity generation is
				at a 15-year low — the list of highs and lows is long and distressing. But the state of the economy is
				worrying not because of these disturbing statistics. These are mere manifestations of a deeper underlying
				malaise that plagues the nation’s economy today.</p>
			<p>A nation’s state of the economy is also a function and reflection of the state of its society. The
				functioning of any economy is the result of the combined set of exchanges and social interactions among
				its people and institutions. Mutual trust and self-confidence are the bedrock of such social transactions
				among people that foster economic growth. Our social fabric of trust and confidence is now torn and
				ruptured.</p>
			<h2>Industrialists live in fear</h2>
			<p>There is a palpable climate of fear in our society today. Many industrialists tell me that they live in
				fear of harassment by government authorities. Bankers are reluctant to make new loans, for fear of
				retribution. Entrepreneurs are hesitant to put up fresh projects, for fear of failure attributed to
				ulterior motives. Technology start-ups, an important new engine of economic growth and jobs, seem to live
				under a shadow of constant surveillance and deep suspicion. Policymakers in government and other
				institutions are scared to speak the truth or engage in intellectually honest policy discussions. There is
				profound fear and distrust among people who act as agents of economic growth. When there is such distrust,
				it adversely impacts economic transactions in a society. When transactions among people and institutions
				are negatively impacted, it leads to a slowdown of economic activity, and eventually, stagnation. This
				perilous state of fear, distrust and lack of confidence among citizens is a fundamental reason for our
				sharp economic slowdown.</p>
			<p>There is an air of helplessness too. Aggrieved citizens find nowhere to go to air their grievances.
				Public trust in independent institutions, such as the media, judiciary, regulatory authorities and
				investigative agencies, has been severely eroded. With the erosion of trust, there is a lack of a support
				system for people to seek refuge against unlawful tax harassment or unfair regulations. This makes
				entrepreneurs lose their risk appetite even further for undertaking new projects and creating jobs. This
				toxic combination of deep distrust, pervasive fear and a sense of hopelessness in our society is stifling
				economic activity, and hence, economic growth.</p>
			<p>The root cause of this rupturing of our social fabric is the Modi government’s ‘mala fide unless proven
				otherwise’ doctrine of governance. The premise of the government’s policy framework seems to be that
				economic participants have mala-fide intent unless they can prove otherwise. This suspicion that every
				industrialist, banker, policymaker, regulator, entrepreneur and citizen is out to defraud the government
				has led to a complete breakdown of trust in our society. This has halted economic development, with
				bankers unable to lend, industrialists unable to invest and policymakers unable to act.</p>
			<p>The Modi government seems to view everything and everyone through a tainted prism of suspicion and
				distrust due to which every policy of previous governments are presumed to be of bad intent, every loan
				sanctioned considered undeserving and every new industrial project deemed to be crony in nature. And the
				government has positioned itself as some saviour, resorting to foolhardy moral-policing policies such as
				demonetisation, which have proved to be ill-thought-out and catastrophic. Wrongful evil characterisation
				of everyone and a ‘good-vs.-evil governance’ doctrine cannot be a recipe for healthy economic growth.</p>
			<p>The role of social trust in economic development has been well-documented, right from the times of Adam
				Smith to the modern-day discipline of behavioural economics. The tearing of our social fabric of trust is
				the fountainhead of our current economic malaise. For economic growth to revive, it is very important that
				our torn social fabric of fear and distrust be stitched and knitted together to enthuse trust and
				confidence. It is very important for businessmen, capital providers and workers to feel confident and
				exuberant rather than being fearful and nervous. This is possible only if the government sheds its ‘mala
				fide-unless-proven-otherwise’ doctrine and begin to trust India’s entrepreneurs.</p>
			<p>India’s economy is perched in a precarious state currently. Incomes are not growing. Household
				consumption is slowing. People are dipping into their savings to maintain similar levels of consumption.
				Headline GDP growth is accruing almost entirely to the creamy layer at the top.</p>
			<h2>Risk of stagflation</h2>
			<p>The real worrying trend is that the <a
					href="https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/retail-inflation-jumps-to-462-in-october-due-to-higher-food-prices/article29963473.ece"
					title="most recent retail inflation numbers">most recent retail inflation numbers</a> have have shown a
				sharp increase, especially the food inflation figure. Retail inflation is expected to rise even further in
				the coming months. Continued increase in inflation combined with stagnant demand and high unemployment
				will lead to what economists term as ‘stagflation’, a dangerous territory from which it becomes very hard
				for large economies to recover. While we are currently not in stagflation territory yet, it is prudent to
				act quickly to restore consumption demand through fiscal policy measures since the impact of monetary
				policy seems muted.</p>
			<p>It is my belief that India’s fragile economic situation calls for the twin policy actions of boosting
				demand through fiscal policy and reviving private investment through ‘social policy’ by inspiring trust
				and confidence in the economic participants in our society.</p>
			<p>India is now a $3-trillion global economic powerhouse driven largely by private enterprise. It is not a
				tiny command and control economy that can be bullied and directed at will. Nor can it be managed through
				colourful headlines and noisy media commentary. Shooting down messengers of bad news or shutting off
				economic reports and data is juvenile and does not behove a rising global economic powerhouse. No amount
				of subterfuge can hide the performance and analysis of a $3-trillion market economy of 1.2 billion people.
				Economic participants respond to social and economic incentives, not diktats or coercions or public
				relations.</p>
			<p>Sadly, this self-inflicted economic wound comes at a time when there is a unique and opportune moment in
				the global economy for India to capitalise. The slowing down of China’s economy and exports has opened up
				a large export opportunity for India to fill. India should aim to garner an elephant’s share of this
				export opportunity by fostering a climate of confidence and economic dynamism away from the current
				climate of fear, distrust and pessimism. With the government having an absolute majority in the Lok Sabha
				and the global oil prices being low, this is a once-in-a-generation economic opportunity to catapult India
				to the next phase of economic development and create new jobs for hundreds of millions of our youth. I
				urge the Prime Minister to set aside his deep-rooted suspicion of industrialists and entrepreneurs and
				nurse us back to a confident and mutually trustworthy society that can revive the animal spirits and help
				our economy soar.</p>
